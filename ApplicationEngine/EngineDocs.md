the application engine acts as an interface between the developers and the **_SimpleGUICS2Pygame_** python import.

It extends the functionality of the import and provides more powerful functions for the game such as
* 3D rendering via model files
* audio handling (playlits, looping, panning, channel volumes)
* 3D spacial audio
* batch handling
* event system (handling + deligates)
* resourse management
* hardware interfacing
* networking
* 2D Physics Engine
* \+ more features


This allows for faster more efficient development with more complex features
providing more creative freedom in the development process by extending the toolset of developers.
